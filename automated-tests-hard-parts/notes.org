* Tasks

Let's refactor and extend a backup tool with testing in mind:

- [ ] Test existing code
- [ ] Implement & test
  - "restore backup"
  - "check backup"
- [ ] Design a dry-run mode

* Agenda

- [ ] What are pure/impure functions and side effects?
- [ ] Managing side effects
  - Push side effect closer to the entry point of your applications or
  - Manage side effects through interfaces and dependency injection
- [ ] Highlighting side effects
  - Architecture view
  - Timeline view
- [ ] Test structure
  - AAA / GWT
  - Snapshot and journey tests
  - Make sure a test can fail
  - Readability
  - Essentials
- [ ] Add behaviour using decorators
- [ ] Bonus
  - Snapshot testing tools
  - Test data builder
  - Testing side effects
  - Code duplication and architecture changes
  - Mocks VS hand-written code
  - Legacy systems
  - (Manual) [[https://florianwinkelbauer.com/posts/2024-08-10-dotnet-coverage][code coverage]]
  - Unexpected use cases for testing frameworks
